<h2>Overview</h2>

<b>Linked Sliders is a small function taken from Dr. Modell's website. 
It is used to measure out and resize data given by users on a slider. 
Users can go in and rate their colleages or fellow classmates on
a scale on different aspects of their contribution.  </b>  

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<b>Linked Sliders works by grabbing a circle and sliding it to the left or right to be able to rate the users given on the scale.</b>
